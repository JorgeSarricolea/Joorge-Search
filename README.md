# [Joorge Search](https://jorgesarricolea.com/joorge-search)
This is a small search engine with simulated Google-like recommendations, the intention is to demonstrate my UI skills.

## Description

In this project, I have decided to clone Google Search with a personal touch. Additionally, I have added a couple of functions that will make it interactive.
