## Description

A Front-End Developer should have the ability to design friendly and responsive interfaces. A good practice is to replicate designs from applications or websites. In this project, I have decided to clone Google Search with a personal touch. Additionally, I have added a couple of functions that will make it interactive.

## Getting Started

To get started with "Joorge-Search", follow these simple steps:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Joorge-Search
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Joorge-Search
```

3. Open the index.html file with Live Server (In VSCode) or with your favorite browser.

## Features

Some of the key features of this project include:

- **Responsiveness:** The UI works for mobile devices and desktop.
- **Search suggestions**: A list of personalized suggestions.
- **Keypress:** It works by pressing the search button or the "enter" key.

> [!TIP]
> In the **main.js** file you can find the suggestions hash table called "suggestionUrls" and you can add or remove suggestions according to your needs.
